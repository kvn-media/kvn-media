# Some FAQs

## **Who are you?**

Well, no-one special, just a 20 year old person interested in computers technology, and anime. \
Name's **Kevin**, `Muhammad Kevin` to be exact. Call me Kevin if you wanna. \
I'm not a professional in any way whatsoever, I do things to have fun and cause it's interesting.

## **Where are you from? Where do you belong?**

I'm from Jakarta, a city in the country of Indonesia.

## **What are you doing currently? What are you learning?**

I'm learning and playing around with a few languages, see pinned repositories for an idea of what I'm up to.

The languages currently are:

- Dart
- JavaScript
- Go
- Kotlin
- Java
- PHP
- Python
- C++
- C
- C#

I wanna write software to entertain myself with challenges and help people. \
Though I don't think I achived the latter goal till now.

<!--## **Eww, I see a weeb profile.**
Can't help it, it's the best way to hide my face on this account
> Why do people hate weebs .-.
## **Cool, what more interests you?**
My interests are quite, weird. They're scattered all over the place. \
I've been fascinated by music and have studied it since the age of 6, I've performed on stage and on air but yeah now I've been away from that. I specialize in key instruments. \
Another thing that interests me is Media Production, aka, working with audio, video and broadcasting media.
> I just like art in general. also feeds the reason of me being obsessed with Japanese drawings (⋟ ﹏ ⋞)-->

## **I wanna talk to you, how can I reach you?**

There ya go, but yeah I might be slow to respond. ＼(￣O￣) \
Just don't be a creep, thanks ● ﹏ ●
